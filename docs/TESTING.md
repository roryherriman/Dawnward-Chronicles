# Testing

## Levels

Every changelog entry, PR and compatibility claim names the highest level it reached. "Compiles" and "passes mocks" never count as "works in game".

| Level | Proves | How |
|---|---|---|
| **L0** Static | The code parses and has no accidental globals or unused variables | luacheck, `std = lua51` |
| **L1** Unit | Core logic is correct | `tests/spec/*_spec.lua` on PUC Lua 5.1 |
| **L2** Mocked integration | Platform and TRP3 adapters behave correctly against a WoW API mock and a fake of TRP3's public API (shaped to match the audited 3.4.1 source) | Same runner |
| **L3** In game, Classic Era | The addon loads, events fire, the UI behaves, TRP3 works alongside it | Manual checklist below. Results are recorded in COMPATIBILITY.md. |
| **L4** In game, Forever | The same on WoW Forever | The same checklist on a Forever client |

A mock or fake is only as good as our understanding of the real thing. That is why the TRP3 fake is built from the audited source of a **specific** TRP3 version, and why L2 can never stand in for L3 or L4.

## Running locally

```bash
python tools/check.py
```

This runs the hygiene scan, then luacheck, then every `tests/**/*_spec.lua` on Lua 5.1. The runner refuses to run on any other Lua version, because WoW is 5.1, and code that passes on 5.3 can break in the client.

Runtime lookup order:

1. `lua5.1` on `PATH`
2. `.tooling/venv` with lupa (embedded PUC Lua 5.1)

luacheck lookup order:

1. `luacheck` on `PATH`
2. `.tooling/bin/luacheck.exe`

A missing tool is a failure, never a silent skip.

## Writing tests

A spec file returns a function that receives the harness and the assertion helpers:

```lua
return function(t, expect)
	t:describe("journal", function()
		t:it("caps entries", function()
			expect.equal(#journal.entries, 500)
		end)
	end)
end
```

The assertion helpers are `equal`, `deepEqual`, `truthy`, `falsy` and `errors(fn, pattern)`.

## In-game checklist (L3/L4)

This checklist will be filled in for each release from v0.1 onward. For each run, record:

- the client build (`/dump GetBuildInfo()`);
- the TRP3 version;
- the date;
- pass, fail or n/a for each item.

v0.1 items (draft):

- [ ] Addon appears in the AddOns list and loads without Lua errors (`/console scriptErrors 1`)
- [ ] `/dawnward` opens, creates and edits a character profile and family history entries
- [ ] Data survives `/reload` and relog. `schemaVersion` is present.
- [ ] Export produces text that imports back identically into a fresh character
- [ ] Simulation mode writes only to `DawnwardChroniclesSimDB`, and turning it off restores real data
- [ ] With TRP3 installed: the status shows the version, the active profile name, and "default profile" correctly. Nothing in TRP3 changes.
- [ ] Without TRP3: no errors, and the integration shows as unavailable
- [ ] In combat: no taint errors and no popups
